## 📃 Note

You should download **pytorch_model.bin** file from  https://drive.google.com/file/d/12phqzt2QiAHjaO-BUDSyzNcmdg835rJG/view?usp=sharing  and replace the **pretrained/pytorch_model.bin** file.

## 📣 Introduction
Biglog is a unified log analysis framework that utilizes a pre-trained language model as the encoder to produce a domain-agnostic representations of input logs and integrates downstream modules to perform specific log tasks.
## ✨ Implementation Details
In pre-trained phase, 8 V100 GPUs (32GB memory) is used. The model is pre-trained with 10K steps of parameters updating and a learning rate 2e-4. Batch size is 512 and the MLM probability is 0.15. Warm-up ratio is 0.05 and weight_decay is 0.01. For the fine-tuning of specific analysis tasks, since only a few parameters in classification heads or pooling layers need updating, only 1 or 2 V100 GPUs (16GB memory) are utilized and the fine-tuning process is within 2 epochs of traversing the dataset. Depending on the complexity of different tasks, learning rate is set between 0.5e-4 and 10e-4 and the batch size is 8 or 32.
